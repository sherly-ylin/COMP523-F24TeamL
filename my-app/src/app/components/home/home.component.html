          <h1>Who We Are and The Purpose:</h1>
      
          <p>
            The UNC Institute for Best Practices conducts IPS (Individual Placement and Support) fidelity evaluations, to assist in enhancing the implementation of IPS, to provide accountability measures to ensure the best possible employment and education outcomes, to support NC in implementing evidence-based practices, and adhere to NC Transitions to Living Community. The UNC Institute for Best Practices has trained IPS lead fidelity evaluators who direct the facilitation of conducting periodic fidelity evaluations for all IPS providers in NC.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assist in the fidelity evaluation process, providers are asked to submit data prior to the onsite review. This data provides information for ratings and guides specific interview questions to ensure accurate ratings. An excel spreadsheet was created to provide all the necessary information, which has been developed into a website platform. The intention is to provide an easier process for providers in collecting and submitting data, with decreased errors, provide evaluators the ability to use formulas to auto populate data to decrease errors in ratings, and to maintain this data more systematically for potential research purposes.

            We ask that you continue to create an ID for everyone on the caseload to maintain data in accordance with HIPAA. The data sets remain similar, which includes person level data, staff level data, closed person level data, job development logs, and activity logs.
